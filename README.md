# On-Your-Heals
 
A first-person survival game. The player takes on the role as a healer in an adventuring party, trying to keep themselves and their team alive.  Managing the health of their ai-controlled teammates, keeping themself positioned out of danger and remaining aware of incoming threats are all vital skills that are needed to progress further.

Work in progress, started as an introductory project done through the _Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D_ course on Udemy.
